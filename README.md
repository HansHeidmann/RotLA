Project 2

As another student and the instructor discussed on Piazza, their is a fairly low chance of the game ending from any situation other than all of the 10 treasures being found. It would make sense to require higher dice rolls for adventurers to find treasure or to require the team of adventurers to amass around 50 treasures to even things up if none of the other game mechanics are to be altered.
