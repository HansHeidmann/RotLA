As another student and the instructor discussed on Piazza, their is a fairly low chance of the game ending from any situation other than all of the 10 treasures being found. It would make sense to require higher dice rolls for adventurers to find treasure, or to require the team of adventurers to amass around 50 treasures, in order to even things up if none of the other game mechanics are to be altered. 

UML

We did not have to change the overall structure of the initial UML diagram other than the removal of the Facility class. 
However the attributes and methods of each class had to be changed quite a bit. The BoardRenderer class saw the largest changes with 5 attributes and 6 methods being added, as well as two methods being removed. Other classes have simliar changes though none are quite as extensive.
